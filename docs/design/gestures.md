# Touch and gestures

BabylonSlate is touch-first. Do not assume hover or right-click.

## Global chrome

| Gesture | Target | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-press (~500 ms, stationary) | Dockview tab/header chrome | Drag panel |
| Long-press (~500 ms, stationary) | Panel content (when menu enabled) | App context menu |
| Tap | Buttons, tabs, list items | Primary action |
| `contextmenu` | Desktop secondary click | Same as long-press menu |

### Native menu suppression

Two mechanisms, both required:

- `-webkit-touch-callout: none` on the shell stops the iOS text callout.
- `useSuppressNativeContextMenu` (applied once at the shell) calls `preventDefault` on `contextmenu` document-wide, so long-press and right-click reach our menu instead of the browser's.

Inputs, textareas, `contenteditable` and anything inside `SelectableText` keep the platform menu, since that is where cut/copy/paste is still wanted.

### Cancellation

`useContextMenu` cancels a pending long-press when the pointer moves past 8px or on scroll (captured document-wide, since `scroll` does not bubble). The 500ms delay and 8px tolerance deliberately match Dockview's `LongPressDetector` defaults, so a panel drag and a context menu can never both fire from one gesture.

## Dockview

- Dockview 8's `dndStrategy` defaults to `'auto'`: HTML5 drag for mouse, pointer events for touch and pen. Touch panel drag therefore needs no extra configuration.
- Tab strips are 52px on coarse pointers; grips are 44px+.
- Sashes stay visually thin (4px) but carry a widened hit area via a transparent pseudo-element, because Dockview sizes the sash element itself from an internal constant that CSS cannot override.
- Panel **content** is a gesture-safe zone — viewport and graph handle their own gestures.
- No popout / floating groups on iOS/Android.

## Viewport (Babylon)

- Two-finger orbit and pinch on canvas.
- Canvas uses `touch-none` so UI chrome does not steal gestures.
- Selection on explicit tap pick, not hover.

## Graph (React Flow)

- One-finger pan/zoom inside graph panel only.

## Document tabs (chrome bar)

- Long-press on grip to reorder (dnd-kit); distinct from Dockview panel drag.
