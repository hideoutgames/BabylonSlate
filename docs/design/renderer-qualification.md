# Renderer qualification

## Model and generated-text lifetime follow-up

The physical A16 run is waived for this follow-up at the user's request; local native and browser fixtures provide its acceptance evidence, without a device-performance claim.

At `ea3c9667`, the targeted `visual-lifecycle.test.ts` and `text2d-bitmap.test.ts` baseline ran against Babylon 9.20: 5 failed, 6 passed. Two valid same-length GLBs aliased the old vertex value. Model and generated-text material counts each grew from 2 to 202 over 200 cycles. Oversized text was accepted under an injected 64-pixel cap, and 64 small cells produced an unnecessarily tall 256-pixel atlas.

At `e36439b1`, the same two explicit files passed all 18 cases. Added cases cover 200 source-generation replacements with native resource/observer counts, failed preparation/retry, late rejection after newer success, retained text after allocation rejection, and changing canvas measurements. The native patch removes retired AssetContainer scene observers; this head's patch identity is `b3f3611b5c6f5cd75f3e70a5df4809d1378275c980a582d7e7e1951ed9731b10` (before integration of the physics patch). The later shared-texture-animation fixture and rich-text markup extension have not yet run.

`e2e/visual-generations.spec.ts` is a test-build-only WebGL2/WebGPU pixel and lifetime fixture with 100 model and rich-text replacements, MSDF plus bitmap fallback, borrowed material survival and rejected-text preservation. Its browser run, affected-consumer checks and scoped static checks are still pending. Its timing samples include the fixture's preparation and draw work; they are not isolated GPU or A16 measurements.

Status: **tooling landed, runs pending.** The sustained route (`e2e/play-sustained-route.spec.ts`, `BL_PERF_SUSTAINED=1`) enumerates on CI and skips without the env flag; no machine with enough free memory has completed a full session yet. Nothing on this page is A16/iOS PWA qualification — desktop Chromium observations only. Budgets live in [perf-budget.md](perf-budget.md); the engine-level design is in [render.md](../architecture/render.md).

## Coverage matrix

"CI" means the standard e2e suite (Chromium, SwiftShader/software WebGPU via `SOFTWARE_WEBGPU_ARGS`). "Local-only (env gate)" specs enumerate but skip without their flag. "Unit" means Vitest coverage with no browser run.

### Backend

| Backend | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| WebGL2 | Default for the whole suite; explicit packed/proof runs in `color-pipeline.spec.ts`, `framegraph-forward.spec.ts`, `framegraph-post-process.spec.ts`, `framegraph-post-process-lifetime.spec.ts`, `player-backend.spec.ts`, `webgpu-backend.spec.ts` (transitions include WebGL2 legs) |
| WebGPU | `color-pipeline.spec.ts`, `framegraph-forward.spec.ts`, `framegraph-post-process.spec.ts`, `framegraph-post-process-lifetime.spec.ts`, `framegraph-shadows.spec.ts`, `scene-post-process-coordinator.spec.ts`, `player-backend.spec.ts`, `webgpu-backend.spec.ts`, `webgpu-previews.spec.ts`, `environment-lighting-webgpu.spec.ts`, `baked-parity.spec.ts` — all through software WebGPU on CI |

### Render path

| Path | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `forward` | `framegraph-forward.spec.ts` (opt-in graph preserves surface pixels and ownership, both backends); `clustered-path-selection.spec.ts` (explicit forward request) |
| `clusteredForward` | `clustered-lights.spec.ts` (native and graph PBR/CEL pixels); `clustered-path-selection.spec.ts` (editor selection, Play, packed player Auto→clustered) |
| `auto` | `clustered-path-selection.spec.ts` (auto resolves `clusteredForward` in editor, Play and packed player; session `renderpath` request is global and non-persistent); `render-path-settings.spec.ts` (project-wide pipeline settings retained through reopen) |

### Style

| Style | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| PBR | Default everywhere |
| CEL | `cel-render-mode.spec.ts`, `cel-hard-steps.spec.ts` (both backends), `cel-shadow-lifecycle.spec.ts`, `clustered-lights.spec.ts`, `framegraph-forward.spec.ts` (pbr and cel captures), `baked-parity.spec.ts`, `webgpu-backend.spec.ts` (WebGPU CEL proof) |

### Features

| Feature | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Shadows | `shadow-refresh.spec.ts`, `cel-shadow-lifecycle.spec.ts`, `framegraph-shadows.spec.ts`, `webgpu-backend.spec.ts` (WebGPU shadow proof), `rendering-baseline.spec.ts` (shadow passes/bytes) |
| Project post-processing effects | `color-pipeline.spec.ts` (bloom/effects chain in packed WebGL2 + WebGPU player and editor viewport) |
| Authored post-process stack | `framegraph-post-process.spec.ts`, `framegraph-post-process-lifetime.spec.ts`, `scene-post-process-coordinator.spec.ts`, `scene-post-process-host.spec.ts`, `post-process-owner-overrides.spec.ts` |
| Baked lighting | `baked-parity.spec.ts` (synthetic-atlas PBR/CEL parity), `baked-player.spec.ts` (Preview Build), `baked-runtime.spec.ts`; authoring side `scene-bake.spec.ts`, `scene-bake-job.spec.ts`, `bake-provider.spec.ts`, `bake-uv.spec.ts` — the quality-tier bake variants are local-only (`BL_BAKE_QUALITY_E2E=1`) |
| SceneLayers | `scene-layer-rendering.spec.ts` (viewport + Play); `runtime-owner-continuity.spec.ts` (moving global layer retained across loading, Play + Preview Build) |
| Particles | `p17-particles.spec.ts` (authored emitter/system, Play billboards, teardown, save/reopen) |

### Hosts

| Host | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Editor viewport | `viewport-shading.spec.ts`, `cel-render-mode.spec.ts`, `rendering-baseline.spec.ts`, `color-pipeline.spec.ts` (bloom), `webgpu-backend.spec.ts`, `viewport-guides.spec.ts` |
| Play | `p4-play.spec.ts`, `qa-animation-overlap.spec.ts`, `tilemap-rendering.spec.ts`, `qa-play-controls.spec.ts`, `play-debug-console.spec.ts`, `runtime-owner-continuity.spec.ts`, `scene-layer-rendering.spec.ts`, `clustered-path-selection.spec.ts` |
| Preview Build | `p14-preview-build.spec.ts`, `baked-player.spec.ts`, `tilemap-rendering.spec.ts`, `runtime-owner-continuity.spec.ts`, `clustered-path-selection.spec.ts` (packed player) |
| Exported player | `p14-export.spec.ts` (unzip-serve-boot-tick), `player-backend.spec.ts` (packed `apps/player` over HTTP, both backends) |

### Recovery

| Event | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Context loss | Unit only (`create-engine.play.test.ts`, `rgbd-texture-lifetime.test.ts` — `noteRestore`, texture release, material invalidation). **Not covered** in e2e: no spec forces a real `WEBGL_lose_context` on a live session |
| Backend switch | `webgpu-backend.spec.ts` (WebGPU→WebGL2→WebGPU through Project Settings, one Engine, undo/redo and Play after) |
| Backend fallback | `webgl2-fallback.spec.ts` (WebGPU requested while `requestAdapter` returns null, rejects, or `navigator.gpu` is absent → one WebGL2 Engine, presented viewport, explicit reason in Project Settings, Play afterwards, no loading-deadline failures), `player-backend.spec.ts` (packed WebGPU player without an adapter presents WebGL2 with `data-backend-fallback`) |
| Scene reload | `runtime-scene-loading.spec.ts` (repeated transitions + Stop, Play + Preview Build), `runtime-owner-continuity.spec.ts` (`changescene` under held paint, both hosts), `rendering-transitions.spec.ts` (viewport blocking reloads) |

## Sustained route

`e2e/play-sustained-route.spec.ts` reuses the performance-room fixture (`e2e/play-performance-fixture.ts`): a deterministic room — floor, three walls, 96 static casters, 16 physics-driven spheres, sun plus six shadow-casting points and two spots — in the minimal test project at the selected quality.

Sequence per run: overlay Play on the editor's shared Engine, 60 s warm-up, then `ceil(minutes / sample)` windows of `BL_PERF_SAMPLE_MS` (default 30 s each, default total 20 min); the same again through a Preview Build (the packed player host on its own Engine). Each window records:

- rAF cadence: fps, interval median/p95/p99, longest, stalls over 33/50/100 ms;
- `longtask` entries (count, total ms);
- canvas CSS/backbuffer dimensions and `devicePixelRatio`;
- `renderDiagnostics()` on the host's test hook: draw calls, `cpuMs`, `gpuMs` (with `gpuAttribution`), the last pressure `FramePressureSample`, `scalingLevel`, scene resource counts (meshes/materials/textures/cachedTextures), accounted `gpuReservations`, shadow passes/bytes, pipeline status and quality limits;
- worker tick rate; `document.visibilityState`.

Artifacts: one JSON attachment per window, a `play-sustained-route` JSON report (env, quality profile, render mode, requested backend, boot timings, per-host engine adapter strings, browser version, headless flag, viewport, page errors) and a `play-sustained-summary` text digest (one line per window). The spec asserts only that the route ran — windows produced samples, the page stayed visible, zero page errors — **it never asserts a frame rate**.

### Running it

```text
BL_PERF_SUSTAINED=1 BL_PERF_QUALITY=low pnpm run test:e2e e2e/play-sustained-route.spec.ts --config playwright.perf.config.ts --project perf-gpu
```

`perf-gpu` is full headless Chromium on the machine's real adapter through ANGLE D3D11; `perf-software` is the ordinary SwiftShader project. Knobs:

| Env | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BL_PERF_SUSTAINED` | off | `1` opts in; otherwise the spec skips (CI no-op) |
| `BL_PERF_SUSTAINED_MINUTES` | `20` | Sampled duration **per host** after warm-up |
| `BL_PERF_SUSTAINED_WARMUP_MS` | `60000` | Warm-up per host before sampling |
| `BL_PERF_SAMPLE_MS` | `30000` | Window length |
| `BL_PERF_QUALITY` | `low` | `low`/`medium`/`high`/`ultra` profile written into the project |
| `BL_PERF_RENDER_MODE` | `pbr` | `cel` selects the CEL project |
| `BL_PERF_BACKEND` | project default | `webgl2`/`webgpu` via the project GPU-backend setting |
| `BL_PERF_LABEL` | — | Free-form run label copied into the report |

## Environment and adapter caveats

- **Not device qualification.** `perf-gpu` measures desktop Chromium on ANGLE D3D11; CI and `perf-software` measure SwiftShader (CPU rasterization, GPU-bound). Neither is the A16/WKWebView/iOS-PWA target; iPad WebGPU symptoms could not be reproduced on Chromium/D3D12. The report embeds `engine.getInfo()`/`getGlInfo()` adapter strings, the probe adapter, browser version and headless flag so no run can be mistaken for device evidence.
- **rAF cadence is a presentation proxy.** `pressure.presentationMs` is the interval between the view's own presented frames — only `playMode` handles report it; editor/prefab viewports feed `cpuMs` only. `gpuMs` is attributed to the view only while it is the Engine's sole rendering view (`gpuAttribution` says which); `cpuMs` is `scene.render()` CPU, not total presentation cost.
- **SwiftShader skews the mix.** CPU-rasterized frames hide CPU-side regressions and exaggerate fill cost; the dynamic-resolution valve will step down on long software runs — that is the valve working, and `scalingLevel` in each window records it.
- **Memory admission.** A full session needs sustained memory headroom; that is why runs are pending on this machine rather than failing.
- **No state between hosts.** The Play and Preview Build windows measure the same scene on two different Engines sequentially; they are not concurrent-load data.

## Acceptance thresholds

From [perf-budget.md](perf-budget.md); read each sustained window against them — the route reports, the reader judges.

| Signal | Budget | Where it lands in the report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame pacing | project `playFrameCap` (default 60 → 16.7 ms interval) | `intervals.medianMs`/`p95Ms`/`p99Ms` per window; a real-adapter run should sit near the cap after warm-up |
| Stalls | counted, not budgeted; the #633 recovery reference showed ~0–7 per 30 s at 60 fps | `stallsOver33Ms`/`50`/`100` |
| Long tasks | zero on a healthy run | `longTasks.count`/`totalMs` |
| Tick | < 8 ms combined, ~5 Hz stats cadence | `tickHz` (~60 while uncapped) plus the diagnostics snapshot |
| Draw calls | low hundreds; `DRAW_CALL_WARN_CEILING` 400 | `drawCalls` in `diagnostics` |
| Memory | accounted textures under `TEXTURE_BYTE_CEILING` (2 GB); geometry warn at `GEOMETRY_BYTE_CEILING` (512 MB) | `gpuReservations.reservedBytes`, `resources.cachedTextures` |
| Leak signal | no growth across windows | `resources.*`, `gpuReservations`, `shadowMapBytes` stable window-over-window |
| Resolution | valve may step down under pressure and must not wedge | `scalingLevel`, `width`×`height`, `pressure` per window |

A window that misses the pacing budget is a measurement to explain, not a spec failure — the assertion set stays at "the route ran clean" so the run always produces evidence instead of a red build.

## Engine ownership follow-up baseline

- Implementation starts at `bf109267b4adf42fe118847f29af1888a8ad1f5e`, after reviewed `ce1162f25cbac930be4789789de6269856e1eb58`. The intervening test-mode and WebGL2-fallback PRs do not change snapshot/physics ownership. Retain the merged #648 vertex-stream patch and existing renderer selection.
- Installed dependencies: Babylon `9.20.0`, Havok `1.3.14`. Packaged and vendored Havok WASM SHA-256: `026917766f534c156286f07975850978dabf17c42e742bbfaaebbcb2215e4e11`. Babylon patch file SHA-256: `2b1f1007a95b4543415a9f67ae023c662b1852b4140a34e710ff68a947bb06f9`; lockfile patch identity: `613782859a2d2336c9cc03314b9e992b211e6607c435e03848d9aa127f314375`.
- Deliveries: A snapshot preparation; B native physics ownership and explicit transforms; C change-driven physics preparation; D installed asset identity, texture leases and stable sprites; E transactional models/text; F particle preparation/playback. Each delivery records targeted evidence separately. No batching, second renderer or general resource framework.
- `snapshot-steady-state.test.ts` measures direct synchronizer preparation for 256 warmed actors with 120 identical, 120 new-frame/unchanged, and 120 moving samples. Native dirty/cleanup calls are counted only inside synchronization; normal render queue resets are excluded. Timing distributions are evidence, not noisy pass/fail thresholds.
- Local browser validation is the requested platform scope; physical A16 verification was explicitly waived. NullEngine evidence does not establish browser output or device performance. Browser/backend results remain unexecuted until recorded for the relevant delivery.

### Delivery A local evidence

Baseline fixture commit `2974e67327a6d486a940f3b40e25d74b75bd2d52`; implementation `ba76a60fa58a1e550ede1f510870a02130b3cd1b`. Windows x64, Node 24.19.0, Babylon NullEngine 9.20.0, texture-free native materials, fixed camera, 256 actors, three warmup renders. Each phase directly applies 120 samples; rendering and fixture mutation are outside the timer.

| Phase | Before median / p95 / p99 (ms) | After median / p95 / p99 (ms) | Global dirty / active cleanup / group cleanup, before → after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identical | 0.174 / 0.809 / 1.650 | 0.117 / 0.389 / 0.664 | 120 / 120 / 120 → 0 / 0 / 0 |
| New frame, unchanged values | 0.125 / 0.157 / 0.206 | 0.084 / 0.173 / 0.290 | 120 / 120 / 120 → 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Position and rotation changes | 0.340 / 0.709 / 1.446 | 0.282 / 1.256 / 2.451 | 120 / 120 / 120 → 0 / 0 / 0 |

These single-run timing distributions were collected while other development processes were active. Medians improved but some tails increased; this is not an isolated browser/device speedup claim. The acceptance result is elimination of the named native operations, stable mesh/material identities, and preserved transforms. The existing coordinator already cached strict readiness in the baseline; this change preserves that behavior rather than claiming a readiness redesign.

- Baseline: the new file had five expected failures for dirty/cleanup calls and flag writes; its coordinator readiness case passed. An earlier fixture using the editor checker texture timed out on NullEngine upload readiness and was corrected before the recorded comparison.
- Passed at the implementation commit: `pnpm --silent agent:wait local --script test -- packages/render/src/snapshot-steady-state.test.ts packages/render/src/snapshot-apply.test.ts packages/render/src/create-engine.play.test.ts packages/render/src/bone-attachment.test.ts` — four files, 192 tests. This covers caller deduplication/command invalidation, stale snapshots, SceneLayers, camera possession, bone attachments, structural failure and transform/readiness behavior.
- Render-package `tsc --noEmit` and ESLint for the two changed TypeScript files passed through shared resource admission. Documentation-only evidence updates reuse those unchanged-source results.
- The warmed measurement case was rerun with `--disableConsoleIntercept` to retain successful timing output; six unrelated cases in that measurement-only invocation were filtered out, not counted as new passes.
- Browser: `pnpm --silent agent:wait local --script test:e2e -- e2e/scene-layer-rendering.spec.ts --project=desktop-chrome` passed both Play and exported Preview Build pixel cases at `2c1f29ae28c795acffe40cf4a78dbee94d3f5879`, with one browser worker. The earlier queued attempt was cancelled and is not counted. This fixture uses project-default rendering settings and does not independently qualify WebGPU or capture an adapter identity; dedicated WebGPU and sustained-device performance are not claimed.
